  - You should copy your [ROMs](https://github.com/libretro/Lakka/wiki/ROMs) and [BIOSes](https://github.com/libretro/Lakka/wiki/BIOSes) to default folder `/storage/emulators/` via [Samba](https://wiki.libreelec.tv/index.php?title=Accessing_LibreELEC#tab=Samba_2FSMB) or FTP.
  - After launching the addon you can enter RetroArch menu with default combo `select + start` in your gamepad or `F1` in your keyboard. Then you can download/update cores from [Libretro buildbot](https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/linux/armhf/latest/) and other assets.
  
- **Advanced Emulator Launcher**:
